# Backlog

Items attached to no milestone, the IDs the 2026-09-28 reorganization retired,
and the owner decisions the milestone pages cite. Open work lives on the
milestone pages [M1](m1.md) to [M7](m7.md); [milestones](../milestones.md)
owns the rules. [Product non-goals](../project.md#design-priorities-and-non-goals)
stay excluded: reconciliation, adoption, force behavior and day-2 mutation need
an explicit product or state-contract change before candidacy. Stage selection
is not one of them, because it gates which blocks an invocation starts and
leaves the plan, the lifecycle unit and ownership complete.

## Parked

A parked item gates no milestone and authorizes nothing. Attaching one to a
milestone page is an explicit request, recorded with its date in the item's
Alias cell.

### B94

Delete the dead setup-binding and legacy prerequisites layer, and share one
retained-native matcher between preflight and the controller stage. **Exit
evidence:** preflight and stage tests over one closure.

### B95

Help and usage polish, and the request fields `inventory.ListRequest.Silent`
and `contexts.CurrentRequest.Short` that only the CLI's result writer reads
through their flags, which `TestEveryRequestFieldIsRead` allowlists. **Exit
evidence:** CLI help goldens.

### B96

Collection metadata and naming polish, including the collection's sanity
README, whose `missing-gplv3-license` note names only documentation stubs
although the ignore file also exempts the real modules with no action plugin
(found in X19). **Exit evidence:** `./scripts/ansible-check`.

### B97

Kind field-table to `Shape` parity and the `Value.Get` path checker. **Exit
evidence:** parity tests over every kind.

### B98

Reduce production comments to what the
[code clarity contract](../architecture.md#self-explanatory-code-and-retained-knowledge)
retains. Most production comments state rationale the contract sends to the
knowledge catalog, and some state invariants that must survive as tests or
names rather than prose. Deciding each one is the work; a blanket strip would
lose the findings the catalog is meant to keep. **Exit evidence:** each
retained comment justified by language, tooling or a maintained contract;
every durable finding moved into `.agents/knowledge/` with its links and
evidence; and a fitness gate that holds the result.

### B99

One vSphere machine-provisioning variant. An arm is a capability package plus
one case of the [target derivation](../substrates.md#selection-and-refusal),
and no consumer of a realized Machine changes; its KubeVirt counterpart is
[B87](m6.md#b87). **Exit evidence:** the exact release, adapter contract, its
two fixed identity and pre-boot task files, failure and replay tests and
real-system qualification; [refused machine arms](../deferred/machine-arms.md)
records the admitted arm.

### B100

One managed `LoadBalancer` lifecycle over the shared managed-service capability
M1f delivered; its `Registry` half is [B68](m3.md#b68). **Exit evidence:** a
typed port, the exact implementation, lifecycle evidence, and failure and
acceptance tests.

### B101

One additional view of available evidence or explicit access, or a dashboard or
completion extension. Its custody half is B10, which [X21](delivered.md#x21--bmc-trust-and-administrator-custody) delivered. **Exit evidence:**
a complete human and machine journey, diagnostics, safety and end-to-end
tests; a cluster inspection or access item also meets the cluster evidence
below.

When a cluster inspection or access item is promoted, its exit evidence
exercises the [cluster discovery](../cli/output.md#cluster-discovery) and
[applicability](../cli/commands.md#cluster-command-applicability) contracts
across OpenShift, OKD, managed Ceph and external Ceph. Cover explicit and
current contexts, selected and excluded names, each applicable and inapplicable
command, missing access metadata or artifacts, unavailable implementations,
context-state and identity refusals, and stable diagnostics and streams. Verify
node-name, FQDN and role-ordinal precedence, declaration-order independence,
multi-role Ceph nodes, `infra` preservation, duplicate-FQDN refusal, and
invalid or out-of-range selectors. Prove inspection uses only permitted
metadata, inapplicable access reads no credential bytes, failed access emits no
descriptor or sensitive result, and successful handoff or export preserves its
payload and output boundary. These tests depend on the promoted use case and do
not expand M1a availability.

### B102

One typed, invertible executable custom-playbook journey. The reserved schema
cannot prove effects, ownership or non-exfiltration; it needs M1e, the plan and
execution extensions of [B62](m3.md#b62) to [B64](m3.md#b64) and a named
journey. **Exit evidence:** a same-change API replacement of the
[reserved shape](../deferred/custom-playbooks.md), immutable source and
dependencies, exact targets, bounded secrets, authorization, continuation,
failure injection and isolated-runner qualification.

### B103

Explicit complete-store restore with logical identity preservation. Copy
restoration changes physical identities and may roll back seal reservations;
[M1c](delivered.md#m1c--context-secret-management) converts no earlier keyring
format and refuses it instead, and offers no backup or restore command.
Controller relocation, left over from C16, waits here too. **Exit evidence:**
coherent snapshot validation, authorized inode rebinding, a fresh key before
writes after rollback, interruption and retry and wrong-store refusal tests;
lifecycle recovery evidence preserved.

### B104

Replace per-ID secret reservations with bounded lifetime allocation. Current
opaque random version and binding IDs retain historical reservation files; a
new allocation scheme must preserve issued-ID non-reuse across crashes and
restore, so it needs [B103](#b103)'s restore semantics. **Exit evidence:**
bounded allocator state, reservation before use, counter and namespace
exhaustion, migration of existing bindings and failed attempts, non-reuse and
crash tests.

### B105

One additional secret-store implementation: a passphrase-protected store, an
external broker or KDF-based custody. **Exit evidence:** the shared
conformance suite, the session-material contract, rotation, tamper refusal and
non-disclosure tests.

### B106

The day-2 surface a completed cluster exposes, beyond bootstrap, continuation
and removal. It stays parked until a product-scope change admits it. **Exit
evidence:** set by that change.

### B107

OpenShift Data Foundation, through IBM Fusion Data Foundation, integrating an
OpenShift cluster with a Ceph cluster Bootwright does not manage. M5 integrates
the Ceph cluster M4 manages instead (D19). **Exit evidence:** set when it is
attached to a milestone.

### B161

The working-tree walk guard follows only assignment statements into package variables, so a range clause assigning with `=` and a write through a pointer are missed; and it still reports a walk over an in-memory filesystem reached through a field, a function result, `fs.Sub` or another package's variable (found in X28). **Exit evidence:** guard fixtures for each shape.

### B162

The diagnostic registry keeps only the last literal prefix of a parameter that flows into two stores, misses a code passed through a method expression, a code-carrying field keyed by another package, and a dot-imported function (found in X27 and X28). **Exit evidence:** registry fixture rows for each.

### B163

The Makefile's `quick` comment and the Go reference still describe `make quick` as the changed packages and their dependents; the plain collection loop's gate checks pytest's status but not that it collects the tests ansible-test runs; and a manual plain run leaves ignored `__pycache__` directories under the collection's tests. **Exit evidence:** the wording, and a collection-count check.

### B164

Nothing checks that `os/signal` is granted to the privilege supervisor alone, although the spec calls its `Begin` the process's one signal subscription; and the composition-root signal test X28 kept repeats what the boundary tests refuse. **Exit evidence:** a grant check and one test.

### B122

JSON results for `plan`, `apply` and `destroy`, which X22 left out (decision
X22-D1), carrying each block's attempts, which the operation result does not
fill today. **Exit evidence:** JSON goldens for each command.

### B165

An automation-only revision still names a whole new bundle area and republishes the same closure into it, because the projection carrying the automation is part of the bundle's identity rather than a layer over a shared foundation. **Exit evidence:** closed layer identities, a foundation reused only when its closure is unchanged, and bounded reacquisition.

### B166

`destroy` admits no stage or block scope, so a recovery removes every block the context owns rather than the one whose digest moved. **Exit evidence:** the authorization and journey of a scoped removal, proof that a scope never leaves a dependent behind, and crash and replay tests.

### B167

An SSH-host provider's hypervisor install frozen as one exact transaction under the controller stage's before-state rules. **Exit evidence:** a frozen-transaction test for the SSH arm.

### B171

Three of X21's custody mutations are caught only by defence in depth: removing the lent area's close, dropping the closed-transaction check, and withdrawing before the removal's record reads done. **Exit evidence:** one test that fails for each mutation alone.

### B179

After a refused setup, the result's Next line always says `bootwright setup`, while the bound refusal's diagnostic names `bootwright setup --purge-old-bundles` (found in X30). **Exit evidence:** a result golden whose Next line follows the refusal's remediation.

### B180

The contextfs retirement fixture sets retained definitions that `Publish` ignores, so its kept-resolution assertion always passes; the controller storage memory double keeps no receipt's resolution append-only and refuses no replaced one, so the storage suite cannot require that retirement drops a retired bundle's resolution; and the kill harness's workspace clone does not copy the journey double's client files (found in X30). **Exit evidence:** fixtures and doubles that fail when the rule breaks.

### B181

A bounded run's rebind is limited to three bindings rather than closed, which a binding that names its consumer would close; that is a keyring format change (left by B139 in X30). **Exit evidence:** a binding format that names its consumer, and a rebind test that refuses any other.

### B193

The agent-install removal observation still resolves the openshift-install and oc paths although it runs no oc read; the destroy that follows needs them (found in X29). **Exit evidence:** an observation that resolves only what it runs.

### B194

The lifecycle's material list adds the SSH identity and host-key files whenever a placement names their Secrets, whatever its connection, so a local placement carrying SSH references still asks for SSH material; since X29 the agent-install decoders refuse such a placement, other decoders do not (found in X29). **Exit evidence:** a material-list test over a local placement.

### B195

Since X29 additional trust bundles reach `install-config`, but `additionalTrustBundlePolicy` stays at the installer default `Proxyonly`, and Bootwright refuses an installation proxy, so the bundles never feed the cluster-wide trusted CA. Whether they should (`Always`) is undecided (found in X29). **Exit evidence:** the decision, with a projection golden.

### B196

ansible-core 2.21.4 keeps a Jinja string-literal escape such as `'\n'` as a backslash and an `n`, so a role that joins with it writes a literal backslash-n; and `renameat2` moves the renamed inode's change time on ext4, XFS, Btrfs and tmpfs, so a status proof across a rename must leave the change time out (both confirmed by probes in X29). **Exit evidence:** a knowledge page for each.

### B197

Two tests still put wwn hints on libvirt guests that admission now refuses; the media store contract suite has no missing-callback clause and its double would panic; the second-implementation secret store fake assigns no sequence; and two runner consume sites keep no test pinning their remediation (found in X29). **Exit evidence:** each test narrowed or added.

### B198

The managed service and artifact server plan impacts print an IPv6 listener unbracketed, as `open-listener fd00::1:3128`, where the emulated BMC's impact prints `[fd00::1]:8000` since X29. **Exit evidence:** impact goldens over IPv6.

### B199

Bash's default word breaks also contain `:`, so a path with `:` breaks completion of the rest of the word as `@` and `=` did, and PowerShell's `,` may belong in the withheld set (not verified on a real shell); and when the candidate cap or the read bound truncates a listing, the shell still inserts the longest common prefix of the partial set (found in X29). **Exit evidence:** the chosen sets and truncation behavior, with completion tests.

### B200

The libvirt host apply runs network and pool autostart on every replay reporting no change, and the observation never reads autostart, so an autostart switched off is re-enabled silently (found in X29). **Exit evidence:** a replay test that reports the change and an observation that reads autostart.

### B201

A failed destroy's remediation still says to repeat the operation to continue it, where the next destroy replaces it; status lists a failed destroy's lost block record as a contradiction beside an offered destroy that no record refuses; and a repeated media add whose adopted stage was rewritten promises a publication its next repeat refuses (found in X29). **Exit evidence:** remediation and status goldens for each.

### B202

Since X29 a newer Index API minor warns in setup's result, but the plan shown before confirmation does not show it, and a failure after a warning-bearing selection drops the warning from its report (found in X29). **Exit evidence:** plan and failure goldens that carry the warning.

## Retired

IDs no longer issued. Where an item took one over, its line here names that
item, whose Alias cell names the old ID too. Searching an old ID over
`specs/milestones/` finds its item's Alias cell, its record in
[delivered](delivered.md), or its line here.

| Old ID | Retired on | Reason and record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V1 | 2026-09-28 | Answered by X14: the identity is the build's trust anchor (S18) and the image is fetched through the listener with its certificate verified (S17). |
| V2 | 2026-09-28 | Folded into [B72](m4.md#b72)'s operator gate. |
| V3, V4 | 2026-09-28 | Folded into [B61](m3.md#b61)'s operator gate. |
| V5 | 2026-09-28 | Folded into the operator gates of B61 and B72: a row accepted before X19 lands is repeated on a build that contains it. |
| S13 | 2026-09-28 | Delivered by [X15](delivered.md#x15--installs-that-neither-strand-nor-over-report); its row was left behind. |
| T1 | 2026-09-28 | Delivered by X15 (cluster goldens) and [X17](delivered.md#x17--goldens-and-checkpoint-harnesses) (records, commands and examples); no bounded remainder was named. |
| C13 | 2026-09-28 | No milestone needs a redistributable release. |
| O9 | 2026-09-28 | It measures the repository's guidance, not the product. |
| C16 | before 2026-09 | Delivered by [M1d](delivered.md#m1d--controller-setup) and [M1e](delivered.md#m1e--lifecycle-engine-and-managed-artifact-serving); controller relocation is [B103](#b103). |
| C17 | before 2026-09 | Promoted into M1h, now [B72](m4.md#b72), as its host-wide media store. |
| C18 | 2026-09-28 | Delivered by `d0980fc3` (refactor(architecture): align packages with the command and port map), which removed its row from the milestones page with no note. |
| C27 | before 2026-09 | Delivered by [X3](delivered.md#x3--machine-ssh-sessions-and-host-trust). |
| R1 | 2026-09-28 | Merged into [B19](m1.md#b19) with C28, whose outcome it was. |
| M2a, M2b, M3, M4, M5, M6 | 2026-09-28 | These rows became items whose Alias cells name them; the numbers M3 to M6 now name milestones. |
| M1h, M5a, M4a, M1i | 2026-09-28 | Became [B72](m4.md#b72), [B73](m4.md#b73), [B61](m3.md#b61) and [B71](m3.md#b71); M-letter IDs are no longer issued. |
| N1 to N5, L2, L4, L5, L6 | 2026-09-28 | Became items whose Alias cells name them; L1 and L3 never existed. |
| K01 to K73 | 2026-09-28 | The audit plan's cluster tokens, defined nowhere in the repository; the grouping stays in Git history. |
| Phase 0 to Phase 4 | 2026-09-28 | The audit plan's ordering; slices carry order now. |
| M1h's (D1) to (D6) | 2026-09-28 | Capability labels that collided with the decision log; they became prose. |
| D13, D15 | never issued | Recorded so nobody looks for them. |

## Decisions

Owner decisions, dated. An item waiting on one not yet taken names it in its
Requires cell as `owner decision: <question>`.

- **D1** (2026-09-26): the substrate owns the machine port as role entry points.
- **D2** (2026-09-26): lifting the physical refusal needs in-tree tests and an
  emulated rehearsal, with real-hardware acceptance before support is claimed.
- **D3** (2026-09-26): the BMC certificate is imported where the BMC supports
  it, otherwise an explicit per-machine disable-verification exception applies,
  never a default, and controller-to-BMC TLS gains a CA bundle.
- **D4** (2026-09-26): administrator access is kept in context custody with
  `cluster kubeconfig`.
- **D5** (2026-09-26): every node presenting this block's own tokenized image
  proves a partial install.
- **D6** (2026-09-26): the first proved UUID and serial are pinned and a
  mismatch refuses.
- **D7** (2026-09-26): non-root SSH accounts refuse at admission for now.
  Read on 2026-09-29 by the session, pending the owner's review, as applying
  to lifecycle placement hosts: the machines managed services and libvirt
  providers name (X22).
- **D8** (2026-09-26): the cluster identity is the build's kubeconfig trust
  anchor, refined on 2026-09-27 (S26) to its admin client certificate, which
  the installer's install-complete rewrite keeps.
- **D9** (2026-09-26): multi-node libvirt stays admitted under F14.
- **D10** (2026-09-26): ansible-core is the latest patch of the qualified 2.21
  minor.
- **D11** (2026-09-26): postcondition decisions stay in Go.
- **D12** (2026-09-26): media completion claims the inputs digest and installer
  version, not an image digest.
- **D14** (2026-09-26): documentation stays in the bundle but leaves the
  automation digest.
- **D16** (2026-09-26): managed-OS waits are frozen as request budgets.
- **D17** (2026-09-28): M3 and M4 are done only with two owner-accepted
  acceptance-ledger rows each: an emulated rehearsal on libvirt guests behind
  sushy-tools Redfish BMCs, and a run on real hardware. Each item keeps the
  gate its own detail names.
- **D18** (2026-09-28): the product scope names MetalLB, IBM Fusion Data
  Foundation, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, Argo CD and GitLab as the
  first add-on packages.
- **D19** (2026-09-28): M5 integrates OpenShift with a Ceph cluster M4 manages;
  an external Ceph cluster is parked as [B107](#b107).
- **D20** (2026-09-29, taken by the session under the owner's instruction to
  proceed with recommendations; pending review): the controller CPython is
  the latest patch of the newest minor the qualified ansible-core supports as
  a controller, and `latest` ignores a newer minor (X22).
- **D21** (2026-09-29, taken by the session under the owner's instruction to
  proceed with recommendations; pending review): an elevated child announces
  that it started, and the held `sudo:` lines decide the outcome only when that
  announcement cannot be proved (X20).
- **D22** (2026-09-29, taken likewise; pending review): an elevated command
  that exits without a result reports `runtime.internal` with exit status 1;
  `runtime.interrupted` still wins after an interrupt (X20).
- **D23** (2026-09-30, taken by the session under the owner's instruction to proceed with recommendations): B9: a controller's CA bundle is the only anchor of its Redfish calls; without one, the system trust store.
- **D24** (2026-09-30, taken by the session under the owner's instruction to proceed with recommendations): B9: a physical Machine's virtual media imports the media certificate by default; `disable-verification` is admitted only on one Machine and refused beside private delivery.
- **D25** (2026-09-30, taken by the session under the owner's instruction to proceed with recommendations): B10: the local keyring becomes `local-keyring-v4`, which holds produced material; an earlier keyring refuses and names the build that reads it.
- **D26** (2026-09-30, taken by the session under the owner's instruction to proceed with recommendations): B10: the custodied kubeconfig is withdrawn when the context's removal of its cluster completes.
