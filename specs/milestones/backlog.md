# Backlog

Items attached to no milestone, the IDs the 2026-09-28 reorganization retired,
and the owner decisions the milestone pages cite. Open work lives on the
milestone pages [M1](m1.md) to [M7](m7.md); [milestones](../milestones.md)
owns the rules. [Product non-goals](../project.md#design-priorities-and-non-goals)
stay excluded: reconciliation, adoption, force behavior and day-2 mutation need
an explicit product or state-contract change before candidacy. Stage selection
is not one of them, because it gates which blocks an invocation starts and
leaves the plan, the lifecycle unit and ownership complete.

## Parked

A parked item gates no milestone and authorizes nothing. Attaching one to a
milestone page is an explicit request, recorded with its date in the item's
Alias cell.

### B96

Collection metadata and naming polish, including the collection's sanity
README, whose `missing-gplv3-license` note names only documentation stubs
although the ignore file also exempts the real modules with no action plugin
(found in X19). **Exit evidence:** `./scripts/ansible-check`.

### B97

Kind field-table to `Shape` parity and the `Value.Get` path checker. **Exit
evidence:** parity tests over every kind.

[B294](m1.md#b294) writes the Machine kind tables' missing rows in M1 (found by the 2026-10-05 audit); the parity tests and the checker stay here.

### B98

Reduce production comments to what the
[code clarity contract](../architecture.md#self-explanatory-code-and-retained-knowledge)
retains. Most production comments state rationale the contract sends to the
knowledge catalog, and some state invariants that must survive as tests or
names rather than prose. Deciding each one is the work; a blanket strip would
lose the findings the catalog is meant to keep. Split on 2026-10-05 into
[B336](m1.md#b336), whose amended rule and ratchet hold the count meanwhile
(D101). **Exit evidence:** each retained comment justified by language,
tooling or a maintained contract; every durable finding moved into
`.agents/knowledge/` with its links and evidence; and B336's ratchet lowered
to the result.

### B99

One vSphere machine-provisioning variant. An arm is a capability package plus
one case of the [target derivation](../substrates.md#selection-and-refusal),
and no consumer of a realized Machine changes; its KubeVirt counterpart is
[B87](m6.md#b87). **Exit evidence:** the exact release, adapter contract, its
two fixed identity and pre-boot task files, failure and replay tests and
real-system qualification; [refused machine arms](../deferred/machine-arms.md)
records the admitted arm.

### B100

One managed `LoadBalancer` lifecycle over the shared managed-service capability
M1f delivered; its `Registry` half is [B68](m3.md#b68). **Exit evidence:** a
typed port, the exact implementation, lifecycle evidence, and failure and
acceptance tests.

### B101

One additional view of available evidence or explicit access, or a dashboard or
completion extension. Its custody half is B10, which [X21](delivered.md#x21--bmc-trust-and-administrator-custody) delivered. **Exit evidence:**
a complete human and machine journey, diagnostics, safety and end-to-end
tests; a cluster inspection or access item also meets the cluster evidence
below.

When a cluster inspection or access item is promoted, its exit evidence
exercises the [cluster discovery](../cli/output.md#cluster-discovery) and
[applicability](../cli/commands.md#cluster-command-applicability) contracts
across OpenShift, OKD, managed Ceph and external Ceph. Cover explicit and
current contexts, selected and excluded names, each applicable and inapplicable
command, missing access metadata or artifacts, unavailable implementations,
context-state and identity refusals, and stable diagnostics and streams. Verify
node-name, FQDN and role-ordinal precedence, declaration-order independence,
multi-role Ceph nodes, `infra` preservation, duplicate-FQDN refusal, and
invalid or out-of-range selectors. Prove inspection uses only permitted
metadata, inapplicable access reads no credential bytes, failed access emits no
descriptor or sensitive result, and successful handoff or export preserves its
payload and output boundary. These tests depend on the promoted use case and do
not expand M1a availability.

### B102

One typed, invertible executable custom-playbook journey. The reserved schema
cannot prove effects, ownership or non-exfiltration; it needs M1e, the plan and
execution extensions of [B62](m3.md#b62) to [B64](m3.md#b64) and a named
journey. **Exit evidence:** a same-change API replacement of the
[reserved shape](../deferred/custom-playbooks.md), immutable source and
dependencies, exact targets, bounded secrets, authorization, continuation,
failure injection and isolated-runner qualification.

### B103

Explicit complete-store restore with logical identity preservation. Copy
restoration changes physical identities and may roll back seal reservations;
[M1c](delivered.md#m1c--context-secret-management) converts no earlier keyring
format and refuses it instead, and offers no backup or restore command.
Controller relocation, left over from C16, waits here too. **Exit evidence:**
coherent snapshot validation, authorized inode rebinding, a fresh key before
writes after rollback, interruption and retry and wrong-store refusal tests;
lifecycle recovery evidence preserved.

### B104

Replace per-ID secret reservations with bounded lifetime allocation. Current
opaque random version and binding IDs retain historical reservation files,
about 32,000 of which a context's keyring admits in its lifetime, and every
bounded run consumes one, so a loop of `machine` power, `rsh` or `exec`
commands exhausts a context (found by the 2026-10-05 audit, which corrected
this item's reason). Split on 2026-10-05 into [B337](m1.md#b337), after which
bounded runs publish no durable binding and only applies and new versions
consume reservations (D85). A new allocation scheme must preserve issued-ID
non-reuse across crashes and restore, so it needs [B103](#b103)'s restore
semantics. **Exit evidence:** bounded allocator state, reservation before use,
counter and namespace exhaustion, migration of existing bindings and failed
attempts, non-reuse and crash tests.

### B105

One additional secret-store implementation: a passphrase-protected store, an
external broker or KDF-based custody. **Exit evidence:** the shared
conformance suite, the session-material contract, rotation, tamper refusal and
non-disclosure tests.

### B106

The day-2 surface a completed cluster exposes, beyond bootstrap, continuation
and removal. It stays parked until a product-scope change admits it. **Exit
evidence:** set by that change.

### B107

OpenShift Data Foundation, through IBM Fusion Data Foundation, integrating an
OpenShift cluster with a Ceph cluster Bootwright does not manage. M5 integrates
the Ceph cluster M4 manages instead (D19). **Exit evidence:** set when it is
attached to a milestone.

### B161

The working-tree walk guard follows only assignment statements into package variables, so a range clause assigning with `=` and a write through a pointer are missed; and it still reports a walk over an in-memory filesystem reached through a field, a function result, `fs.Sub` or another package's variable (found in X28). **Exit evidence:** guard fixtures for each shape.

### B162

The diagnostic registry keeps only the last literal prefix of a parameter that flows into two stores, misses a code passed through a method expression, a code-carrying field keyed by another package, and a dot-imported function (found in X27 and X28). **Exit evidence:** registry fixture rows for each.

### B163

The Makefile's `quick` comment and the Go reference still describe `make quick` as the changed packages and their dependents; the plain collection loop's gate checks pytest's status but not that it collects the tests ansible-test runs; and a manual plain run leaves ignored `__pycache__` directories under the collection's tests. **Exit evidence:** the wording, and a collection-count check.

### B164

Nothing checks that `os/signal` is granted to the privilege supervisor alone, although the spec calls its `Begin` the process's one signal subscription; and the composition-root signal test X28 kept repeats what the boundary tests refuse. **Exit evidence:** a grant check and one test.

### B122

JSON results for `plan`, `apply` and `destroy`, which X22 left out (decision
X22-D1), carrying each block's attempts, which the operation result does not
fill today. **Exit evidence:** JSON goldens for each command.

### B165

An automation-only revision still names a whole new bundle area and republishes the same closure into it, because the projection carrying the automation is part of the bundle's identity rather than a layer over a shared foundation. **Exit evidence:** closed layer identities, a foundation reused only when its closure is unchanged, and bounded reacquisition.

### B166

`destroy` admits no stage or block scope, so a recovery removes every block the context owns rather than the one whose digest moved. **Exit evidence:** the authorization and journey of a scoped removal, proof that a scope never leaves a dependent behind, and crash and replay tests.

### B167

An SSH-host provider's hypervisor install frozen as one exact transaction under the controller stage's before-state rules. **Exit evidence:** a frozen-transaction test for the SSH arm.

### B171

Three of X21's custody mutations are caught only by defence in depth: removing the lent area's close, dropping the closed-transaction check, and withdrawing before the removal's record reads done. **Exit evidence:** one test that fails for each mutation alone.

### B180

The contextfs retirement fixture sets retained definitions that `Publish` ignores, so its kept-resolution assertion always passes; the controller storage memory double keeps no receipt's resolution append-only and refuses no replaced one, so the storage suite cannot require that retirement drops a retired bundle's resolution; and the kill harness's workspace clone does not copy the journey double's client files (found in X30). **Exit evidence:** fixtures and doubles that fail when the rule breaks.

Since X31 the contextfs retirement fixture holds real resolutions, so its kept-resolution check is meaningful; the memory double also retires an area no resolution names, which the store refuses.

### B181

A bounded run's rebind is limited to three bindings rather than closed, which a binding that names its consumer would close; that is a keyring format change (left by B139 in X30). **Exit evidence:** a binding format that names its consumer, and a rebind test that refuses any other.

### B193

The agent-install removal observation still resolves the openshift-install and oc paths although it runs no oc read; the destroy that follows needs them (found in X29). **Exit evidence:** an observation that resolves only what it runs.

[B309](m3.md#b309) makes the installation block's tool-resolution failure deterministic; this item keeps the removal observation's resolution.

### B194

The lifecycle's material list adds the SSH identity and host-key files whenever a placement names their Secrets, whatever its connection, so a local placement carrying SSH references still asks for SSH material; since X29 the agent-install decoders refuse such a placement, other decoders do not (found in X29). **Exit evidence:** a material-list test over a local placement.

### B196

ansible-core 2.21.4 keeps a Jinja string-literal escape such as `'\n'` as a backslash and an `n`, so a role that joins with it writes a literal backslash-n; and `renameat2` moves the renamed inode's change time on ext4, XFS, Btrfs and tmpfs, so a status proof across a rename must leave the change time out (both confirmed by probes in X29). **Exit evidence:** a knowledge page for each.

### B197

Two tests still put wwn hints on libvirt guests that admission now refuses; the media store contract suite has no missing-callback clause and its double would panic; the second-implementation secret store fake assigns no sequence; and two runner consume sites keep no test pinning their remediation (found in X29). **Exit evidence:** each test narrowed or added.

### B199

Bash's default word breaks also contain `:`, so a path with `:` breaks completion of the rest of the word as `@` and `=` did, and PowerShell's `,` may belong in the withheld set (not verified on a real shell); and when the candidate cap or the read bound truncates a listing, the shell still inserts the longest common prefix of the partial set (found in X29). **Exit evidence:** the chosen sets and truncation behavior, with completion tests.

### B226

Status compiles the imported revision and refuses when it no longer compiles, so a context imported with a retired field, since X31 a Secret file source, loses status until `context update`, although its destroy still works (found in X31). **Exit evidence:** status over such a revision reporting its records.

### B227

A continuation run by its registering build over a bundle a later build reprojected passes the closure check and is refused only per attempt by the runner, after its log is restored and it is marked running; comparing the receipt's automation digest before the restore would refuse first (found in X31). **Exit evidence:** a continuation test that refuses before any record changes.

### B229

A knowledge page keyed on `SyntaxWarning: invalid decimal literal` for the ansible-check area name (B203), and the carry-forward page citing the test that carries a settled receipt forward (found in X31). **Exit evidence:** the pages.

X32 found the mechanism: ansible-core renders its home defaults through Jinja's native environment, whose concatenation parses the text, so any home path in which a number runs into a keyword warns in every process; CPython also warns for other number forms, such as `1_1if`, `1e1if` and `0x1fif`.

### B230

No test pins the pre-plan refusal of a pending receipt whose bundle is incompatible; the lifecycle test double's held area lets a removal skip its closed and read-only checks; and no runner test pins a partial record waiting at the drain after a failed exit, whose outcome X31 made unknown (found in X31). **Exit evidence:** each test.

### B231

After a completed setup, `--purge-old-bundles` retires superseded areas but leaves the superseded resolutions of the receipt's own bundle until a setup at the bound needs their room (found in X31). **Exit evidence:** a purge test that retires them.

### B232

Since X31 a run request lends a block only the Secret parts it writes, but each attempt's execution and quiescence probe still hand the capability's Go code the whole reopened operation map, the artifact server's key included (found in X31). **Exit evidence:** a port through which a capability declares its blocks' parts, with a test that another block's key is absent.

### B235

The lost-binding refusal names its operation and binding only in its message, because a diagnostic's object is an API object; and a refusal inherited from an Environment default gets the generic inherited-field remedy in place of its own, so a file source from a default names `secret set` only in its message (found in X31). **Exit evidence:** a diagnostic shape for such objects and inherited remedies kept.

### B238

Setup's bound decision never counts controller-stage resolutions as retirable, so a host holding ones an earlier build accumulated keeps them until the same selection solves again and setup at the bound blames client areas; after a completed setup, the purge reports stage resolutions as retired execution bundles although it removed nothing; and resolutions of a selection no context makes any more are never retired (found in X32). **Exit evidence:** bound, purge-report and retirement tests over stage resolutions.

**Partly settled in [X35](delivered.md#x35--the-decision-of-2026-10-03).** The purge after a completed setup names and reports only the areas the store holds, and retires a resolution whose bundle holds no area only when it belongs to setup's own closure, so it neither reports a controller stage's resolution as a retired execution bundle nor retires it; `TestSetupsPurgeLeavesAControllerStageResolution` pins this over the real store. The bound clause and the stale-selection clause stay parked.

### B243

An apply keeps room for one removal directory, so at the directory bound a failed removal's replacement refuses at registration; a removal's byte admission covers only its registration, so its records and logs can still stop it part way at the byte bound; and when the reserve cuts an attempt's output to nothing, the attempt log records nothing (found in X32). **Exit evidence:** bound tests for a replacing removal and for a removal's records, and a log entry for dropped output.

### B245

Since X32 the adapter output prints nothing a failed `no_log` task raised, so completion refusals that name only fields, never values, now print nowhere; role comments still say ansible-core keeps nothing of such a failure; and the censor overrides a private ansible-core method that a move past 2.21 must re-qualify (found in X32). **Exit evidence:** a decision per refusal, the comments, and the re-qualification note.

### B247

An SSH placement recognized as the controller has its socket, unit and path claims compared only within its context and never published, so another context on the controller is not refused over them; a controller whose sshd listens on a port other than 22 is not recognized; one host reached by a name and an address is not recognized; and bridge readiness pairs providers and services by Machine name (found in X32). **Exit evidence:** the decision, and planning tests for each.

### B248

The artifact server's observation never compares the container's start with its configuration, unit or serving material, so an unknown resolution of an apply stopped before its restart can record it done while nginx serves an earlier configuration; and since X32 a managed-service apply whose host clock stepped back restarts on every attempt until the clock passes the file's time (found in X32). **Exit evidence:** observation and apply tests for both.

### B256

Since X33 both awaiting-split lists are empty, but the collection's line-limit test still says their split is B47, and the Go test's failure message still offers adding a function to the list although the list only shrinks (found in X33). **Exit evidence:** both texts corrected.

### B258

No command prunes retained operations, so a context at the 1024-operation bound leaves only through destroy and deletion (D52). Pruning needs a rule for which completed operations no block's ownership and no audit depends on. **Exit evidence:** the retention rule, and a pruning journey that keeps every operation the index names.

### B261

A carried-forward pending receipt does not record the bundle it was carried from, so its resume acquires every source from the publisher again, and the controller spec's rule that a carried resolution consults no publisher does not survive an interruption (found in X34). **Exit evidence:** a resume test that reads the retained bytes.

### B262

Below the bound, a pending receipt whose bundle holds no area and that another executable recorded still refuses only at preparation, after setup presented its plan, published its intent and reserved an empty area; and the purge's help and the bound refusal do not name the stranded case (found in X34). **Exit evidence:** a refusal before any effect, and the texts.

### B263

Since X34 a retained bundle that lost a bootstrap source falls back to a fresh resolution, but its retained row ends as a failure with no warning naming the lost source, and the fresh resolution downloads every source again, including those the retained bundle still holds (found in X34). **Exit evidence:** the display, and a seeded resolution.

### B266

The host block runs before any Machine of its apply is realized, so the running Machines X34's drifted-network refusal names can only be domains a deleted context left behind, and `machine stop` refuses each of them as not realized; the refusal could name the domain and stopping it on the host. The network and the Machines also reach only the retained output, because an adapter refusal cannot carry names it read (found in X34). **Exit evidence:** a refusal whose exit runs.

### B267

Since X34 the retained-operation refusal names destroy, but a removal refused at its own registration names an orphan-acknowledged delete and a fresh init, since destroy would refuse again; a fresh apply's claim does not reclaim idle claims under pristine evidence before counting them; and status still offers `apply` over a context at the bound (found in X34). **Exit evidence:** the owner's exit, a reclaim before counting, and the status step.

### B268

The storage contract suite has no clause for the store's rule on settled receipts: a failed or canceled receipt keeps no intent or unknown effect, and every observed action carries evidence. Since X35 the prerequisites memory double enforces it, but no contract clause holds a future double to it (found in X35). **Exit evidence:** a contract clause both stores pass and a double without the rule fails.

### B269

When a setup at the bound fails after its first durable effect, the cancellation of a stranded receipt or a retirement, its result reports the outcome `planned`, which implies nothing changed, and does not name the cancellation (found in X35). **Exit evidence:** a failure after the cancellation and one after a retirement, each reported with what changed.

### B273

X37 moved Go only to the newest 1.26 patch, go1.26.8, while go1.27.1 is the newest release. Go 1.27 backs `encoding/json` with its v2 implementation, whose error texts may differ, drains an HTTP/1 response body on close and removes five TLS and X.509 GODEBUG settings, so the move changes product behavior and is the owner's decision (found in X37). **Exit evidence:** the owner's decision; for a move, `scripts/go` and both modules' `go` directives on 1.27 with every gate passing, and those changes reviewed against the product's JSON records, refusals and goldens and its HTTP acquisition.

### B274

The Ansible check gate runs on CPython 3.13, while fresh setups resolve the newest 3.14 patch, the newest minor ansible-core 2.21 supports as a controller. Moving the gate re-platforms it rather than bumping a pin: `scripts/tools/ansible_check.py` runs ansible-test with `--python 3.13` and `origin:python=3.13`, and `scripts/tools/ansible-test-artifacts.json` holds cp313 wheels of MarkupSafe and PyYAML for ansible-test 2.21.4's exact sanity pins (found in X37). **Exit evidence:** the owner's decision; for a move, the gate interpreter and its lock, the artifact lock and those arguments on 3.14, with the full gate passing.

### B322

Client areas count toward the 16-area bound, but nothing removes one, so a long-lived controller eventually wedges setup and the controller stage (found by the 2026-10-05 audit); [B292](m1.md#b292) gives the refusals their remedies and corrects the spec. `setup --purge-old-bundles` would retire a client area that no context binding or proved stage names, the controller record keeping each context's proved area in a field omitted when empty. **Exit evidence:** a purge that retires an unnamed client area and keeps every named one, and the record field.

### B323

Managed-service and artifact-server removals release their socket reservations without proving the sockets free (found by the 2026-10-05 audit); [B301](m1.md#b301) adds the Not-yet-met line. Each reserved socket would be probed after the stop, and its absence required in both absence checks. **Exit evidence:** absence tests in which a socket still held refuses the release.

### B324

An orphan-acknowledged context deletion names `bootwright status --context <name>` as its inventory since [B291](m1.md#b291). A Reconciliation guard port could list the owned blocks in the refusal, the prompt and the result, which serves real machines better (found by the 2026-10-05 audit). **Exit evidence:** the port, and refusal, prompt and result goldens that list the blocks.

### B325

Store-wide verification refuses every command for every context when one context is damaged; since [X39](delivered.md#x39--untrusted-input-trust-and-privilege-boundaries) the refusal names the damaged entry and admits that context's purge where the purge removes the damage. Isolating the damage per context, listing it with its reason and admitting its purge would keep the healthy contexts usable, at the cost of the store's fail-closed verification (found by the 2026-10-05 audit). X39 found two more cases it would serve: a ready context whose reservation is missing or unsafe cannot be purged, because the deletion lease verifies that reservation, and a damaged context that still owns live objects cannot be destroyed, because destroy verifies every context's mapping, so its only exits are `--allow-orphans` and a whole-store restore. **Exit evidence:** store tests in which a damaged context is listed and purged while the others keep working, a context whose reservation is missing purged, and a damaged context that owns live objects destroyed.

### B327

An Anaconda installation needs a static IPv4 install address, because completion dials and pins the frozen address, and [B289](m1.md#b289) refuses a DHCP-only installation at admission. DHCP installation needs its own completion design (found by the 2026-10-05 audit). **Exit evidence:** that design, with completion and replay tests.

### B328

`internal/reconciliation/lifecycle/execution.go` holds the operation's decision, registration, removal gates and completion in about 1,600 lines, with registration and completion split across files (found by the 2026-10-05 audit). A pure move into one file per concern would make each easier to read. **Exit evidence:** the move with no behavior change, and `make check`.

### B329

Top-level declarations run together against the formatting rule in about 103 places, mostly in container-cluster admission and storage, and two projection names mislead (found by the 2026-10-05 audit). **Exit evidence:** an architecture-suite check with every case fixed, and the two renames.

### B330

A RHEL controller resolves client closures from UBI sources only, and UBI carries no `lorax` or `xorriso`; since [B288](m1.md#b288) the operator installs both from the host's entitled repositories. An adapter over the host's enabled repositories or a Satellite could freeze RHEL client closures as UBI sources are frozen (found by the 2026-10-05 audit). **Exit evidence:** a frozen closure from an entitled source, with acquisition, signature and replay tests.

### B331

On a FIPS-mode controller host, Bootwright's Go binary and its private CPython use their own cryptography, outside the host's validated modules, which [B292](m1.md#b292) documents and preflight reports. Qualifying FIPS would use Go's FIPS 140-3 module and a private CPython linked to the system OpenSSL FIPS provider (found by the 2026-10-05 audit). **Exit evidence:** a qualified FIPS build and runtime, with setup and a lifecycle run on a FIPS-mode host.

### B332

`auth.operatorIdentity` promises the invoking operator's own SSH identity, but the session client runs as root with root's default identities, which [B283](m1.md#b283) documents. Running the arm's client under the invoking account, with its default identities and `-l` defaulting to that account, would build on [B282](delivered.md#x39--untrusted-input-trust-and-privilege-boundaries)'s helper (found by the 2026-10-05 audit). **Exit evidence:** argv and session tests under the invoking account.

### B333

A DNSServer's bind address defaults to the wildcard address, which collides with any other resolver on the host; since [B299](m1.md#b299) the pre-start check names the colliding socket. Deriving the default from the single endpoint address moves the effective state and request digests of live contexts, so it waits for a later window (found by the 2026-10-05 audit). **Exit evidence:** a normalization test deriving the bind address, and the effective-state and request goldens.

### B334

The emulated BMC runs as root, unconfined, with the libvirt socket, and serves plain HTTP with a basic-auth credential; [B301](m1.md#b301) binds the examples' BMCs to loopback. TLS from the emulator with a generated certificate its client verifies, a refusal of a non-loopback bind address once an installation's provider host must be the artifact server's placement ([B289](m1.md#b289)), and a confined SELinux type would shrink that surface (found by the 2026-10-05 audit). **Exit evidence:** the emulator's TLS with a verifying client, the refusal and the confined type, each with tests.

### B335

No harness exercises RHEL 9.8's dnf 4.14, rpm 4.16, Python 3.9 and keyring import, so setup's dnf4 path has never run on RHEL (found by the 2026-10-05 audit); [B288](m1.md#b288) marks RHEL 9.8 admitted but not yet run, and a run on a disposable RHEL 9.8 controller qualifies it (D60). An operator-run harness in a ubi9 container could exercise resolution, inspection and signatures. **Exit evidence:** the harness and a recorded run of it.

### B341

The plan's template-delimiter refusal also scans native passthrough content, such as a composed NMState document, overrides and a StorageCluster's service specification, so legitimate native syntax holding `{#`, such as a shell's `${#var}`, cannot be planned; and the refusal names the block's object and request path, for example every service a controller `noProxy` entry reaches or a line of a Machine's Kickstart, rather than the authored object and field the operator edits (found in X39). B244 accepted the trade-off; a reviewed escape or a per-field scope for native content is the owner's decision. **Exit evidence:** that decision with its tests, and refusals naming the authored object and field.

### B345

In a human invocation sudo's sudoers denial, such as `Sorry, user ... is not allowed to execute`, carries no `sudo: ` prefix, so the holding filter forwards it and only a JSON invocation gets the remedy naming a rule for the procfs re-execution; at a terminal the operator sees sudo's own text, while the operator guide says each refusal names which case applies (found in X39). Holding sudo's untranslated policy lines in a human noninteractive invocation, and printing one remedy line after an interactive refusal, would close it; otherwise the guide and the CLI spec say which sudo text means the rule is missing. **Exit evidence:** elevation rows in which a human invocation's policy denial ends with the mapped remedy, or the reworded guide and spec.

### B346

The libvirt guest-agent identity proof and `machine rsh` and `exec` pin `ssh-ed25519` host keys, and it is unverified whether a FIPS-mode RHEL 9.8 controller's OpenSSH verifies an explicitly pinned Ed25519 key; if it refuses, lab-rhel cannot complete on such a controller and the identity path needs the key-type work [B73](m4.md#b73) does for physical installation (found in X39). **Exit evidence:** a recorded check on the D109 controller in FIPS mode before the real-hardware run, and, if it refuses, a pinned type the controller's policy admits on that path.

### B348

Each resolution of the invoking account runs `getent` three times, and the composition resolves lazily for selection, home, UID and each opener session, although the invoking identity cannot change within one invocation; and a directory account whose GECOS field holds `:` or a line break is refused as ambiguous with no remedy that names the field (found in X39). **Exit evidence:** one resolution per process, counted by a test, and a refusal naming the passwd field the name service returned.

### B352

The invoking-account helper's root path, that is a root process opening for another account, runs only as euid 0, so `TestRootHelperOpensWithTheInvokingCredentials`, `TestRootSelectionAdapterFixture` and the opt-in privileged account fixture skip in every gate; no gate exercises a directory account or a root-squashed network home, where root's reads of helper-issued descriptors run under a squashed or machine credential; and capacity refusals were proved with a file-size limit, never a full filesystem or a quota (found in X39). **Exit evidence:** those tests passing as euid 0 on a disposable host or a root-capable runner, and a recorded operator check on a controller whose operator has a directory account and a root-squashed home: `context init`, `secret set` from files and `media add --from-file` under sudo, and the root-login refusal.

### B353

The planning test of every proven request path skips its package and proxy-URL-path rows now that admission refuses those values first, and its `noProxy` and bridge rows will skip once the route and bridge grammars land, so the scan is no longer exercised through them; the name-service bounds, 10 s and 64 KiB per lookup, are not pinned by `TestDocumentedBoundsMatchCode`; `TestCancellationStopsAcquisitionBeforeItOpensAnything` passes no opener, so it cannot show that none was begun; the input and secret readers keep process-credential wrappers only for their older tests; and the controller-prerequisites integration target writes its request as plain JSON, unlike the runner (found in X39). **Exit evidence:** request-reaching rows or explicit admission assertions in place of the skips, the bounds pinned, an opener that fails if begun, the wrappers removed, and the target writing the runner's document.

### B354

The architecture spec says `validate -f`, `context init` and `context update` read one input directory under the same credentials, but an unelevated `validate -f` reads with the login session's groups and the elevated commands with the account database's, which differ until the operator logs in again; the operator guide says store commands refuse on a host an earlier build manages, which holds only for a store this build cannot read; the managed-OS spec's derived-installation paragraph does not say that every Kickstart value is one token the renderer refuses otherwise; the contexts spec does not say that context init and update read under the invoking account or list the `input.read` denials; and the security spec does not name the root-squash refusal beside the private-file rule (found in X39). **Exit evidence:** each page corrected.

### B355

Two lessons have no knowledge page: pykickstart splits a file as Python's `str.splitlines` does, so vertical tab, form feed, the file, group and record separators, NEL and U+2028 and U+2029 start lines, tokenizes command lines with `shlex` comments enabled and cuts `%packages` lines at `#`; and one terminal hangup delivers SIGHUP twice to a foreground job, once from the shell and once from the kernel (found in X39). **Exit evidence:** the pages, indexed by symptom.

## Retired

IDs no longer issued. Where an item took one over, its line here names that
item, whose Alias cell names the old ID too. Searching an old ID over
`specs/milestones/` finds its item's Alias cell, its record in
[delivered](delivered.md), or its line here.

| Old ID | Retired on | Reason and record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V1 | 2026-09-28 | Answered by X14: the identity is the build's trust anchor (S18) and the image is fetched through the listener with its certificate verified (S17). |
| V2 | 2026-09-28 | Folded into [B72](delivered.md#x38--the-real-host-run-of-2026-10-05)'s operator gate. |
| V3, V4 | 2026-09-28 | Folded into [B61](m3.md#b61)'s operator gate. |
| V5 | 2026-09-28 | Folded into the operator gates of B61 and B72: a row accepted before X19 lands is repeated on a build that contains it. |
| S13 | 2026-09-28 | Delivered by [X15](delivered.md#x15--installs-that-neither-strand-nor-over-report); its row was left behind. |
| T1 | 2026-09-28 | Delivered by X15 (cluster goldens) and [X17](delivered.md#x17--goldens-and-checkpoint-harnesses) (records, commands and examples); no bounded remainder was named. |
| C13 | 2026-09-28 | No milestone needs a redistributable release. |
| O9 | 2026-09-28 | It measures the repository's guidance, not the product. |
| C16 | before 2026-09 | Delivered by [M1d](delivered.md#m1d--controller-setup) and [M1e](delivered.md#m1e--lifecycle-engine-and-managed-artifact-serving); controller relocation is [B103](#b103). |
| C17 | before 2026-09 | Promoted into M1h, now [B72](delivered.md#x38--the-real-host-run-of-2026-10-05), as its host-wide media store. |
| C18 | 2026-09-28 | Delivered by `d0980fc3` (refactor(architecture): align packages with the command and port map), which removed its row from the milestones page with no note. |
| C27 | before 2026-09 | Delivered by [X3](delivered.md#x3--machine-ssh-sessions-and-host-trust). |
| R1 | 2026-09-28 | Merged into [B19](m1.md#b19) with C28, whose outcome it was. |
| M2a, M2b, M3, M4, M5, M6 | 2026-09-28 | These rows became items whose Alias cells name them; the numbers M3 to M6 now name milestones. |
| M1h, M5a, M4a, M1i | 2026-09-28 | Became [B72](delivered.md#x38--the-real-host-run-of-2026-10-05), [B73](m4.md#b73), [B61](m3.md#b61) and [B71](m3.md#b71); M-letter IDs are no longer issued. |
| N1 to N5, L2, L4, L5, L6 | 2026-09-28 | Became items whose Alias cells name them; L1 and L3 never existed. |
| K01 to K73 | 2026-09-28 | The audit plan's cluster tokens, defined nowhere in the repository; the grouping stays in Git history. |
| Phase 0 to Phase 4 | 2026-09-28 | The audit plan's ordering; slices carry order now. |
| M1h's (D1) to (D6) | 2026-09-28 | Capability labels that collided with the decision log; they became prose. |
| D13, D15 | never issued | Recorded so nobody looks for them. |

## Decisions

Owner decisions, dated. An item waiting on one not yet taken names it in its
Requires cell as `owner decision: <question>`.

- **D1** (2026-09-26): the substrate owns the machine port as role entry points.
- **D2** (2026-09-26): lifting the physical refusal needs in-tree tests and an
  emulated rehearsal, with real-hardware acceptance before support is claimed.
- **D3** (2026-09-26): the BMC certificate is imported where the BMC supports
  it, otherwise an explicit per-machine disable-verification exception applies,
  never a default, and controller-to-BMC TLS gains a CA bundle.
- **D4** (2026-09-26): administrator access is kept in context custody with
  `cluster kubeconfig`.
- **D5** (2026-09-26): every node presenting this block's own tokenized image
  proves a partial install.
- **D6** (2026-09-26): the first proved UUID and serial are pinned and a
  mismatch refuses.
- **D7** (2026-09-26): non-root SSH accounts refuse at admission for now.
  Read on 2026-09-29 by the session, pending the owner's review, as applying
  to lifecycle placement hosts: the machines managed services and libvirt
  providers name (X22).
- **D8** (2026-09-26): the cluster identity is the build's kubeconfig trust
  anchor, refined on 2026-09-27 (S26) to its admin client certificate, which
  the installer's install-complete rewrite keeps.
- **D9** (2026-09-26): multi-node libvirt stays admitted under F14.
- **D10** (2026-09-26): ansible-core is the latest patch of the qualified 2.21
  minor.
- **D11** (2026-09-26): postcondition decisions stay in Go.
- **D12** (2026-09-26): media completion claims the inputs digest and installer
  version, not an image digest.
- **D14** (2026-09-26): documentation stays in the bundle but leaves the
  automation digest.
- **D16** (2026-09-26): managed-OS waits are frozen as request budgets.
- **D17** (2026-09-28): M3 and M4 are done only with two owner-accepted
  acceptance-ledger rows each: an emulated rehearsal on libvirt guests behind
  sushy-tools Redfish BMCs, and a run on real hardware. Each item keeps the
  gate its own detail names.
- **D18** (2026-09-28): the product scope names MetalLB, IBM Fusion Data
  Foundation, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, Argo CD and GitLab as the
  first add-on packages.
- **D19** (2026-09-28): M5 integrates OpenShift with a Ceph cluster M4 manages;
  an external Ceph cluster is parked as [B107](#b107).
- **D20** (2026-09-29, taken by the session under the owner's instruction to
  proceed with recommendations; pending review): the controller CPython is
  the latest patch of the newest minor the qualified ansible-core supports as
  a controller, and `latest` ignores a newer minor (X22).
- **D21** (2026-09-29, taken by the session under the owner's instruction to
  proceed with recommendations; pending review): an elevated child announces
  that it started, and the held `sudo:` lines decide the outcome only when that
  announcement cannot be proved (X20).
- **D22** (2026-09-29, taken likewise; pending review): an elevated command
  that exits without a result reports `runtime.internal` with exit status 1;
  `runtime.interrupted` still wins after an interrupt (X20).
- **D23** (2026-09-30, taken by the session under the owner's instruction to proceed with recommendations): B9: a controller's CA bundle is the only anchor of its Redfish calls; without one, the system trust store.
- **D24** (2026-09-30, taken by the session under the owner's instruction to proceed with recommendations): B9: a physical Machine's virtual media imports the media certificate by default; `disable-verification` is admitted only on one Machine and refused beside private delivery.
- **D25** (2026-09-30, taken by the session under the owner's instruction to proceed with recommendations): B10: the local keyring becomes `local-keyring-v4`, which holds produced material; an earlier keyring refuses and names the build that reads it.
- **D26** (2026-09-30, taken by the session under the owner's instruction to proceed with recommendations): B10: the custodied kubeconfig is withdrawn when the context's removal of its cluster completes.
- **D27** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B29: a foreign image on one of the cluster's own Machines reads as partial during an agent-install removal.
- **D28** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B34: an SSH-host provider's hypervisor packages resolve at apply time; the frozen transaction is parked (B167).
- **D29** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B40: admission refuses `spec.lifecycle.rescue` until a rescue journey exists.
- **D30** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): Follow-ups a slice finds enter M1 only when they are safety or defect items; enabling and polish follow-ups are parked unless they block an M1 item.
- **D31** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B137: `status` offers as next steps only the verbs the records allow.
- **D32** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B140: the cluster boot budget is 300 seconds per node with a 900-second floor; polled reads still count as answered at once.
- **D33** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B141: the agent-install decoders refuse, for every verb, a frozen placement off the controller; the runner refuses a material listed twice.
- **D34** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B143: a proved UUID or serial refuses anything that is not printable, by the CLI's printable rule.
- **D35** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B146: a YAML key is refused for the construct it carries (`yaml.alias`, `yaml.tag`), as a value is.
- **D36** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B41: the Secret `file` source is retired; operators load files with `secret set`.
- **D37** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B42: a lost frozen binding refuses before any effect and names the exits: restore the keyring, or an orphan-acknowledged delete.
- **D38** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B43: an unresolvable unknown block keeps its refusal, which names why and how to fix it; the orphan-acknowledged delete also releases host reservations.
- **D39** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B136: a failed apply whose blocks are all done is recovered; the other two refused states name their exit.
- **D40** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B44: only the remaining bundle-area limit is fixed; the layer is parked (B165).
- **D41** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B45: a continuation freezes its Python and Ansible closure and refuses when it moves; scoped removal is parked (B166).
- **D42** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B46: local setup keeps its Ansible output in its own bounded run area, the newest eight runs.
- **D43** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B122: lifecycle JSON results are parked until a milestone names a consumer.
- **D44** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B111: validation refuses wwn, hctl and serial root-device hints on a libvirt Machine.
- **D45** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B116: the emulated BMC admits canonical IPv6 unicast bind addresses, with a bracketed endpoint and the shared socket key.
- **D46** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B131: media publication proves nothing wrote the stage after it was measured, and the spec says so; the pre-X20 long-name leftover is removed by hand.
- **D47** (2026-09-30, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B158: a newer Index API minor version makes setup warn and continue; a newer major version refuses.
- **D48** (2026-09-30, the owner): M1 is frozen after X33. Follow-ups X32, X33 and later slices find are parked here for a future milestone, whatever their kind, instead of entering M1; D30 no longer admits items to M1. M1 keeps its open items: X32, X33, the owner decisions and the chain behind B49.
- **D49** (2026-10-01, the owner accepted the session's recommendation A): B32: after a stall the install role reads the registered hosts from the rendezvous host's assisted-service API with the watcher token, bounded and under `no_log`, and the give-up names the node.
- **D50** (2026-10-01, the owner accepted the session's recommendation A): B175: `setup --purge-old-bundles` retires superseded areas under a pending receipt whose bundle holds no area, then resumes it.
- **D51** (2026-10-01, the owner accepted the session's recommendation A): B188: a drifted running network restarts when its Machines are stopped and otherwise refuses before any effect, naming them.
- **D52** (2026-10-01, the owner accepted the session's recommendation A): B206: the retained-operation refusal names destroy, then context deletion and a fresh init; pruning is parked (B258).
- **D53** (2026-10-01, the owner accepted the session's recommendation A): B208: a retained bundle that lost a bootstrap source falls back to a fresh resolution.
- **D54** (2026-10-01, the owner accepted the session's recommendation A): B220: before a wait, the install role restores a truncated installer kubeconfig from the kept copy when it names the same cluster.
- **D55** (2026-10-03, the owner accepted the session's recommendation A): B175: under `setup --purge-old-bundles`, a receipt stranded at the bound that this executable cannot resume is recorded as canceled, its never-started bundle publication observed as such, and a fresh setup follows; D50's resume stays for one it can prepare.
- **D56** (2026-10-05, the owner): M1 gates the owner's full bar: well-defined specs; architecture and code that follow best practices; well-structured, domain-constrained APIs with input validation; good UX and CLI output; and a CLI ready for every controller function (context, secret, media, setup, preflight, validate, render effective, status, plan, apply, destroy and the machine commands) and for creating RHEL machines on libvirt and sushy-tools. This amends D48: M1 takes the parked B94, B95, B179, B198, B200 to B202, B222 to B225, B228, B233, B234, B236, B240 to B242, B244, B246, B249, B252, B255, B257, B264, B270 to B272 and B275 to B277, and the new B278 to B302 and B336 to B338.
- **D57** (2026-10-05, the owner): B17 to B24: X23 is dropped, and X24 keeps B19 to B22, re-planned with the role and request fixes of its lanes. B17 keeps its ID for the managed-OS work area's relocation, and B303 splits from it with per-invocation scratch, disjoint namespaces and the two-concurrent-installs test; B24 keeps its ID for cross-context scoping and an attributed refusal, and B304 splits from it with the exemption of an invocation's own in-flight jobs. B18, B23, B303 and B304 move to M3, B18 recording that context reads refuse during an apply and taking B265 into its exit evidence, and the parked B195, B237, B239, B250, B251, B259, B260 and B265 join them there.
- **D58** (2026-10-05, the owner): B72: the lab-rhel ledger row of 2026-10-05, which matches B72's acceptance baseline and gate, is accepted for B72 too, so B72 leaves M4 for X38's record; the defects the run found stay M1 items.
- **D59** (2026-10-05, the owner): M1's closing operator gate is the extended lab-rhel run on a clean build of X44's landing, on a host missing at least one native root so that setup or the controller stage downloads through the Python path: setup with the new bundle, media, context, secrets, a staged apply, preflight, plan, apply, `status` with its four JSON checks, `machine list` and `--power-status`, `machine exec` and `rsh`, restart, a destroy refused and then `machine stop`, destroy, a fresh apply, a host restart, `machine start` and `stop`, destroy, `status` after the destroy, the unit and time checks and an explicit `qemu-img info --force-share` read. One owner-accepted row completes the real-host evidence of B19, B20 and B277.
- **D60** (2026-10-05, the owner): the real xFusion test follows M1, which closes without physical installation, and B73 to B78 stay in M4, B74 to B77 outside any planned slice. On the owner's explicit request of 2026-10-05, X45, the slice the session's plan called XB, runs out of sequence right after X43 and X24, in the same digest window, and delivers B73's repair and B305, the Redfish client on the owner's xFusion iBMC. A run on a disposable RHEL 9.8 controller, the lab-baremetal rehearsal and one xFusion server with a reduced first-test profile, run from a separate RHEL 9.8 controller (D109) and recorded as an observation, follow it.
- **D61** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B279 and B295: `spec.libvirt.uri` is an enumeration holding `qemu:///system`, which closes the command transports escaping cannot.
- **D62** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B280 and B282: an operator whose account comes from a directory service resolves through NSS with a pinned, root-owned `getent` under the same single-entry and clean-home checks, `/etc/passwd` serving only where `getent` is absent, and a `sudo -i` root shell resolves as direct root.
- **D63** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B281: store-wide verification stays, but a damaged context's refusal names the context, the store-relative entry and the errno, and `context delete --name <it> --purge` runs over exactly that context; per-context isolation is parked as B325.
- **D64** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B283: an installed Machine's SSH session defaults `access.ssh.addressRef` to its `ssh` address, else its install address, else its FQDN, and the mismatch refusal gains a remedy.
- **D65** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B283: a new or replaced trust record whose address collides with the record of a Machine the context no longer declares replaces it in the same confirmed write, shown as a remove row.
- **D66** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B283 and B287: every remedy and next step that names a command carries `--context`, and every per-object prompt names the context.
- **D67** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B275: after a removal, `status` reports a shared service whose destroy is done or released as `pending`, a failed one as `failed` with the token `[FAIL]`, and a running or unknown one as `unknown`.
- **D68** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B284: `status` relabels `Bound` as the bindings count and reports 0 once a completed removal finalized, so that status still reads no keyring.
- **D69** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B222: over a lost binding, `status` offers `bootwright apply` first, which finalizes without reopening the binding, then the orphan-acknowledged delete.
- **D70** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B284 and B300: the `machine list` and `media list` JSON rows rename `address` to `contact` and `ips` to `addresses`, with the columns CONTACT and ADDRESSES, before any consumer exists.
- **D71** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B285: a Secret declaration's fingerprint drops its provenance and covers type, source and parameters only, and a stored version whose fingerprint equals the legacy one stays current.
- **D72** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B285: `secret set` keeps its strict input-file rule for files carrying a value, password, token or private key, and accepts a certificate or public-key file that is a regular single-link file, not writable by others and owned by the invoker or root.
- **D73** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B285: `--value-stdin` and `--password-stdin` at a terminal prompt on standard error with echo off and read one line for tokens and passwords; opaque and `dockerConfigJson` values refuse a terminal with a pipe-or-file remedy.
- **D74** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B287: Bootwright's own refusals before a `machine exec` or `rsh` session opens, `trust.identity` included, exit 255, and once the session opened its own status wins over an interrupt.
- **D75** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B287: a declined or non-interactive confirmation reports its consumer's existing code, with the confirmer's reason and the `--yes` remedy.
- **D76** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B287: the CLI and command specs say that destroy's proofs needing the exclusive lock or a remote observation follow the prompt and still refuse before registration, and the plan names the Machines that must be stopped.
- **D77** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B288: controller egress keeps a pure route grammar for endpoint and bypass at admission and selection, and the executable's limits on a managed proxy, authentication, private trust and extra capabilities refuse as controller Unsupported rows with remedies.
- **D78** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B289: an installation that selects an external DNSServer or NTPServer uses its declared address with no requirement edge.
- **D79** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B289 and B338: network overrides are composed, and secondary addresses, MTUs, non-install bonds and VLANs and extra routes refuse before registration on a Bootwright-installed Machine; post-install NMState convergence is B326 on M4, before B80.
- **D80** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B289: DHCP-only Anaconda installations refuse at admission, and both specs say so; DHCP installation is parked as B327.
- **D81** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B289: MachineImage and hosted-tree media narrow to `local-media:<name>`, and installed consumers need the `redfishVirtualMedia` endpoint.
- **D82** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B289: an installation whose image or tree server is not on the controller refuses before registration, the managed-OS spec is corrected and the unused install tooling deleted.
- **D83** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B249: a Machine and a MachineInstallProfile of one name that publish through one server refuse at admission.
- **D84** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B225: the runs area keeps the newest runs per context, removing the oldest before a new one, as D42 does for setup runs.
- **D85** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B104 stays parked for bounded lifetime allocation, its reason corrected to state that every bounded run consumed a reservation; the narrow fix, in which `machine` power, `rsh` and `exec` read their material in one keyring session and publish no durable binding, splits out as B337 in M1.
- **D86** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B290: media URLs are HTTPS only, in validation, the acquirer, help and the specs.
- **D87** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B291: an identical `context update` over a completed apply keeps the selected revision, reports it unchanged and asks nothing, and changed input over a completed apply warns before the prompt.
- **D88** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B291: an orphan-acknowledged deletion names `bootwright status --context <name>` as its inventory in the refusal and the prompt, and the specs narrow to that; a guard port that lists the owned blocks is parked as B324.
- **D89** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B236: `--allow-orphans` may abandon a context whose evidence is unreadable or differently spelled, saying that its objects cannot be listed, and the refusal names that exit.
- **D90** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B292: M1 ships the remedies and the corrected spec sentence for a 16-area bound held by client areas; their retirement by `setup --purge-old-bundles` is parked as B322.
- **D91** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B202: setup prints resolution warnings with the plan, before the prompt.
- **D92** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B228: setup runs and bounded runs share one 4 MiB output bound.
- **D93** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B271: D55's cancellation extends to a pending setup receipt below the bound that this executable cannot resume, including one whose native action refused before authorizing any transaction.
- **D94** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B294: the dead InfraProvider and Machine fields leave v1alpha1: the libvirt provider's `bmcEmulationDefaults.disableCertificateVerification` is removed; the bare-metal attachment's `vlan` is removed, coordinated with B74; bare metal no longer requires the `attachmentRef` nothing reads; `hardware.boot.nicRef` is removed; and `hardware.nics` MACs and `management.bmc` on a libvirt provider's Machines refuse at admission.
- **D95** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B294: one managed attachment name or bridge on two libvirt providers of one host refuses at admission, naming both providers.
- **D96** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B296: installation media is pinned as the managed-OS spec says: plan freezes the store record's size and digest, a declared checksum must match, and each attempt proves size and digest before first use.
- **D97** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B296: the Kickstart renders formats with their glibc langpack, repositories as `%post` `.repo` files with `gpgcheck`, `gpgkey` and `name`, and a credential-free external proxy that exempts the artifact endpoint; `passwordAuthentication: true` refuses while `initialPassword` does, and the architecture enumerates `x86_64`.
- **D98** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B17 is split: the managed-OS work area moves under a root-only 0700 parent in M1's digest window, and the rest of B17 is B303 in M3.
- **D99** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B19 is not split: progress emission tasks stay in roles, one shared plugin base carries per-capability evidence functions, postcondition decisions stay in Go (D11), and B19's text and the architecture spec's Not-yet-met line are refreshed.
- **D100** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B300: `version`'s `Dependency bundle` field is the embedded automation digest, computed at composition.
- **D101** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B98 stays parked for pruning the narration; the amendment allowing short rationale and safety-invariant comments in the architecture spec, with a shrink-only per-package ratchet on the comment count, splits out as B336 in M1.
- **D102** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B301 adds a Not-yet-met line for removals that release service socket reservations without proving the sockets free; the proof is parked as B323, for the per-capability evidence functions B19 creates.
- **D103** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B73: the per-machine installer ISO is published only under the private token subtree and withdrawn after completion, the in-installer `curl --cacert` fetch stays, and private delivery requires a verified controller-to-BMC leg, because InsertMedia carries the token URL.
- **D104** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B305 and B319: on the xFusion iBMC, under `established` trust, the client reads `VerifyCertificate` and `HttpsTransferCertVerification` before the insert and refuses private delivery when either reads false, the operator importing the CA out of band, within B73's repair; the manager SecurityService root-CA import follows as B319, before the first real-hardware row.
- **D105** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): the parked B96 to B107, B122, B161 to B167, B171, B180, B181, B193, B194, B196, B197, B199, B226, B227, B229 to B232, B235, B238, B243, B245, B247, B248, B256, B258, B261 to B263, B266 to B269, B273 and B274 stay parked.
- **D106** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B288: a RHEL controller accepts `lorax` and `xorriso` the operator installed from the host's own entitled, vendor-signed repositories, proved by presence like any root; an entitled-source adapter is parked as B330.
- **D107** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B292 and B297: the execution foundation keeps its byte-exact guard at every launch and gains a named check, a refusal naming package, build and file, a documented hold procedure and a regeneration tool in B292; in B297, within X43's window, setup qualifies vendor-signed glibc and libgcc within the qualified minor against the RPM database and records the proved digests as the receipt's requirement.
- **D108** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B292: on a FIPS-mode controller host, Bootwright's runtime brings its own cryptography, which the docs state and preflight reports beside the host's FIPS mode; a FIPS-qualified runtime is parked as B331.
- **D109** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): the real-hardware test runs this build on a separate RHEL 9.8 controller in a subnet the BMC network reaches on the artifact ports, touching nothing on the owner's bastion; B280's host guidance says so.
- **D110** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B301 and B73: the operator owns the controller host's firewall, and the docs list each listener's ports by source with firewalld commands; a per-socket readiness check in preflight and plan is B318, before B78.
- **D111** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B282: operator-named paths are opened by a bounded helper under the invoking credentials, which passes the descriptors to root, and root keeps every proof.
- **D112** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B283: the machines spec documents what `auth.operatorIdentity` does today; running its client under the invoking account is parked as B332, after B282.
- **D113** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B305: generated serving certificates stay P-256; B305 records the iBMC's RSA premise with its check and, as the workaround, a `contextStore` RSA-2048 certificate set with `secret set`; a `keyType` for generation follows only if that check fails.
- **D114** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B299: a DNSServer keeps its wildcard bind default, the new pre-start check names a colliding socket, and the examples and docs declare explicit binds; a derived default is parked as B333.
- **D115** (2026-10-05, accepted by the owner from the session's recommendations): B301: the examples bind their emulated BMCs to loopback, and the docs state that a privileged or cleartext-credential listener binds loopback or a host-only address unless its network is trusted; emulator TLS, a refusal of a non-loopback bind address and a confined SELinux type are parked as B334.
- **D116** (2026-10-06, the owner): every safety or defect follow-up a slice finds in M1's journeys joins M1, folded into the next fitting slice or a final sweep slice before the closing run (D59); enabling and wording follow-ups stay parked. This amends D56 and D48 for follow-ups found from X39 on: a safety or defect follow-up found in M1's journeys joins M1 on the planned sweep slice X46, or on an earlier planned slice whose lane already owns its files, with the Alias `new, <date> (<slice>); attached to M1 on <date> (D116)`; an enabling, wording, test-depth or knowledge follow-up stays parked under D48. M1 takes X39's parked safety and defect follow-ups B339, B340, B342 to B344, B347, B349 to B351 and B356 on X46.
